the camera was a marvel ,positive,camera,camera[+1],
it is versatile and seems to be one of the best ,positive,camera,camera[+3],[p]
i chose the g3 because of its reputation for very high quality  clean images ,positive,g3,g3[+1],
the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focuslocks  even in bright light   and the unsatisfactory light quality of the builtin flash ,negative,"time, flash","time[-2], flash[-2]",
what makes the focuslock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f8 ,positive,depth,depth[+1],
relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr  the internal flash on the g3 produces harsh  flat images with ugly hot spots ,negative,flash,flash[-2],
fortunately  the g3 has a hot shoe that can take an external flash  and fortunately for me  i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy  the metz 60 ct4 ,positive,shoe,shoe[+1],
contrary to what ive read elsewhere  the g3 does sync at 1250 of a second with thirdparty flashes  just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon ,positive,flash,flash[+2],
now there is one more complaint i have about the g3 and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images  i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the 32 mbyte cf with a 512 mbyte cf  which gives me 130 raw images  as opposed to 7 ,negative,software,software[-2],
the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all  but the raw image after it has been processed by all the imageaffecting settings in the camera ,negative,software,software[-2],
what this plugin reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g3 hardware ,positive,g3,g3[+3],
without any tweaking at all  if the exposure is accurate  the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film  and this is a raw image ,positive,color,color[+3],
the adobe camera raw plugin shows once again that hardware is miles ahead of software ,positive,"g3, software","g3[+3], software[-2]",
what the g3 raw image software gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical ,negative,software,software[-2],
but at least youre starting with the most photorealistic images ive ever seen from a camera ,positive,image,image[+3],
i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g3  in conjunction with my professional flash system   and can easily put up with the cameras limitations  because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits ,positive,image,image[+3],
i ve had this for 3 months now  and i am pleased with my decision ,positive,camera,camera[+2],[p]

the service from the supplier was exceptional ,positive,service,service[+3],
having used it for more than a month  i can say that it consistently produces topnotch photos ,positive,photo,photo[+3],
by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot  i was able to produce excellent stopaction photos  contrary to what other reviewers experienced ,positive,photo,photo[+3],
the camera is a dream to operate in automode  but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority  shutter priority  and manual modes ,positive,"automode, mode","automode[+2], mode[+2]",
about the only legitimate criticsm from the online reviews is that fact that the lens really does obstruct the viewfinder ,negative,viewfinder,viewfinder[-2],
i can t write enough positive things about this great little camera ,positive,camera,camera[+3],
but canon never fails to amaze ,positive,canon,canon[+3],

2  battery life is over 45 hours  compared to about 25 hours for the g2 or the 2 hours for most nikons ,positive,life,life[+1],
3  the remote capture and fileviewer software bundled for photo capture is mindblowing ,positive,software,software[+2],
4  the shape of this device is a little squarer  without losing the weight which means better balance and less shaking while clicking ,positive,shape,shape[+1],
the light autocorrection is awesome ,positive,correction,correction[+2],
you could take a picture of a stone glinting in the sun and still avoid the shining glaze and get the contours right ,positive,picture,picture[+2],
8  perhaps inspired by the canon s factory whitecorrection settings  which were found lacking and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc could be cleaned out   the g3 has much sharper white offsets ,positive,offset,offset[+2],
overall  the g3 delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current  4 megapixel digicams  from a detail  tonal balance and color response point of view ,positive,g3,g3[+3],
this is quite simply the best you can ask for ,positive,camera,camera[+3],[p]
the g3 had problems focusing in low light and would not take the picture when the shutter was pressed but after the shutter had been released a few seconds ,negative,focus,focus[-2],

4mp  4x optical zoom  takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above 5mp cameras  easy to understand and use  has a great swivel lcd screen   a lot of features and addon options  comes with great software  not to be overlooked   and last but by far not least  received my fiance s stamp of approval  two thumbs up  ,positive,"photo, use, software","photo[+3], use[+3], software[+2]",
the powershot g3 is a great camera ,positive,camera,camera[+2],
because it can help a soso photographer take spectacular photos ,positive,photo,photo[+3],
4 megapixels is plenty for all but pros  and you will not be disappointed with the results of this camera ,positive,camera,camera[+2],
it s slightly lighter than the g2 and packed with even more features ,positive,feature,feature[+1],
the catch with the canon g3 camera   and perhaps all of digital cameras  is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots ,negative,unresponsiveness,unresponsiveness[-2],
it sometimes takes the picture at some indefinite period of time after you press the shutter button ,negative,delay,delay[-1],[u]

i love it  ,positive,player,player[+3],[p]
this product is too fragile for normal use ,negative,player,player[-2],[p]
i had no problems setting up the software and getting my favorite cd s transferred ,positive,software,software[+1],
however  the creative software is not real intuitive ,negative,software,software[-1],
the software is somewhat nice to look at  using it is not the easiest ,negative,software,software[-2],
if you want to rename a cd title that you have already transferred  you will become frustrated quite quickly ,negative,rename,rename[-2],

it is great sounding  even with the supplied earbuds ,positive,sound,sound[+2],
i must have differing preferences than others here  as i prefer the supplied earbuds to the sony s that i thought sounded good on other players ,positive,earbud,earbud[+2],
i love the storage in this thing ,positive,storage,storage[+3],
this is ridiculous ,negative,warranty,warranty[-3],[p]
the scroll wheel  to be blunt  sucks ,negative,wheel,wheel[-3],

the interface used could be better designed ,negative,interface,interface[-2],
it is a little cumbersome to scroll through so many levels to get to the selection you want ,negative,interface,interface[-2],[p]
and the case  how did this ever make it out of quality control ,negative,case,case[-3],
it is some protection for the unit  but for useability  forget it ,negative,case,case[-3],[p]
the cutouts for the controls is not thought out as there is too much material in the way to adequately access the controls  especially the scroll wheel ,negative,control,control[-2],
despite the things that i have listed so far  i could live with this item since it saves me from lugging a cd case to work  to the gym  in the car  etc ,positive,player,player[+2],[p]
however the main reason i am not satisfied with this product is the fact that it will lock up at odd times ,negative,up,up[-2],
quite simply  the firmware and  or the os that control this thing is not ready for prime time ,negative,firmware,firmware[-2],
i know this unit will have problems in the future and the  40 for the 2 year  no questions asked  replacement warranty will be worth it  since creative will only warrant it for 90 days  which in itself is totally ridiculous ,negative,warranty,warranty[-3],
this is my second creative labs mp3 player  and it is definitely a fine product ,positive,player,player[+3],
1  the size is a little bit bigger than the ipod  and it weighs a little bit more ,negative,"size, weight","size[-1], weight[-1]",

the price compared to the ipod is great ,positive,price,price[+2],

the software  which comes with player is not good at all ,negative,software,software[-2],
i did not managed to make creative nomad explorer to work ,negative,explorer,explorer[-2],

the nomad is not ugly  it is not that big  it comfortably fits in my pocket  or heavy  and the controls are not hard to get used to ,positive,"style, size, control","style[+1], size[+1], control[+1]",[u]
so far i have no complaints and i recommend this to anyone who wants quality over appearance  also anyone who wants a harddrive based mp3 player and wants to pay next to nothing ,positive,player,player[+2],[p]

it has a few inconveniences  one is that the songs do not automatically play one after another like on a cd ,negative,play,play[-1],
another irriation is that if you hold the scroll button down for too long  it keeps going past the song you may have wanted to stop on ,negative,scroll,scroll[-2],
otherwise  this player is awesome ,positive,player,player[+3],
it has a clear blue light that allows you to see everything on the screen easily ,positive,screen,screen[+2],

as often mentioned  the scroll tab is average  however  not difficult to use or horrible ,positive,scroll,scroll[+1],
the screen is large  defined  and easy to read  and the silver unit is naturally cool ,positive,screen,screen[+2],
there are lots of interesting features included such as eax  and customization ,positive,feature,feature[+1],
 the replacable battery is great since once it eventually wears out  as all lithium batteries do   you will be able to buy another easily ,positive,battery,battery[+2],
also  the nomad s 14 hours of battery life versus 8 is handy ,positive,life,life[+2],
 equipment included is average  but that is nt a big deal since thats not what you are buying it for ,positive,equipment,equipment[+1],
the case is strong and stylish  but unfortunately lacks a window  now a big deal  ,negative,case,case[-1],
the headphone earbuds are average  so just use your regular pair instead ,positive,headphone,headphone[+1],

i m very pleased with my zx so here s a quick review ,positive,zx,zx[+3],[p]
it is small overall  bigger than the ipod  but keep in mind that this is because different  less expensive but not necessarily inferior technology is used in the zx ,positive,size,size[+1],[u]
the zx boasts superior sound quality than the ipod  however it compromises a bit of the unit s size in doing so ,positive,quality,quality[+3],
the lcd is larger than the previous model  the nx  and has a bright blue backlight which illuminates the screen more successfully than the nx s green backlight did ,positive,lcd,lcd[+2],
the scroll wheel is easy to use and works great for me  however many have complained that the wheel is cumbersome and difficult to operate ,positive,wheel,wheel[+2],
the sound is excellent as one would suspect from a creative product ,positive,sound,sound[+2],
the included eax support is useful at times  especially when you listen to a variety of genres  as it will adjust the equalizer for you which can be a big hassle ,positive,eax,eax[+2],
the environmental audio  however  is almost completely useless and has made most of my songs sound worse than without it  i encode my songs at 192256 kbps without variable bit rates  ,negative,audio,audio[-3],
the signal to noise ratio  the ratio of detectable  useful data to unusable garbage in  say  a radio wave  a larger stn ratio is better  is nice and high at 98 decibles  and it should be noted that apple refuses to release the stn ratio of any of the ipods ,positive,ratio,ratio[+2],
the software has nt been a hassle for me at all ,positive,software,software[+2],
lastly  the price is fantastic ,positive,price,price[+3],
i uploaded the drivers and new software in 15 minutes  no crashes or problems ,positive,software,software[+2],
usb 20  very fast,positive,0,0[+3],

it looks very cool  and seems quite small to me and very light ,positive,"look, size, weight","look[+3], size[+2], weight[+2]","[u], [u]"
the scroll button seems ok  i have no problems with it ,positive,scroll,scroll[+1],
i am very pleased so far ,positive,player,player[+3],[u]

1  a spare battery would have been great ,negative,battery,battery[-1],
2  no games  it has a cool screen  why not use it ,negative,game,game[-1],
3  it does not work automatically like a hard drive when you connect it to your computer  like some players,negative,work,work[-1],
all in all suprisingly easy to use ,positive,use,use[+3],
lots of flaws  but exceptional sound quality  hd size  and price make it a good buy ,positive,"quality, size, price","quality[+3], size[+2], price[+2]",
excellent sound  i found the music reproduced faithfully through the jukebox ,positive,sound,sound[+2],
transfer through windows explorer  windows recognizes the jukebox as an additional hard disk  so it allows you to simply drag and drop files from windows explorer to a folder for the nomad ,positive,transfer,transfer[+2],
i found it very useful for transferring large files to another computer ,positive,transfer,transfer[+3],
huge storage space  even at 320kbs  you can store a ton of songs on this thing ,positive,storage,storage[+3],
having usb 20 makes for very fast transfers ,positive,transfer,transfer[+2],
navigation system  the zen xtra uses id3 tags that are embedded in the mp3 files to organize your songs ,negative,navigation,navigation[-2],
fm receiver  it has none ,negative,receiver,receiver[-2],
cheap construction  they should have made the player out of hard plastic and put some rubber on the corners ,negative,construction,construction[-2],
the player feels very delicate  as if i m holding an actual hard drive ,negative,feel,feel[-1],

software  the software is crap ,negative,software,software[-3],
i use it for ripping cds  which it does a pretty good job of ,positive,cd,cd[+2],
otherwise  it is difficult to figure out and awkward ,negative,software,software[-3],[p]
even after reading some of the instructions  it s still hard to figure out ,negative,instruction,instruction[-1],
no line out jack  as i said  there is none ,negative,jack,jack[-1],
it sounds decent  but i would estimate you get maybe 80  of the quality that you would from a true line out jack ,negative,jack,jack[-1],
controls are a bit awkward ,negative,control,control[-2],
it was nt as easy to fast forward or pause a song than it was with a regular walkman ,negative,control,control[-2],[u]
crappy headphones ,negative,headphone,headphone[-3],
the included earbuds were uncomfortable ,negative,earbud,earbud[-2],
difficult navigation  i wo nt necessarily say  difficult   but i do nt enjoy the scrollwheel to navigate ,negative,navigation,navigation[-3],
it is a bit cumbersome  and i can t get to the songs i want as quickly ,negative,navigation,navigation[-2],
i think this is it s biggest flaw ,negative,navigation,navigation[-3],[p]
up  down  left  and right would have given me better control ,negative,control,control[-1],
if you hold down the scroll wheel too long  which is common if you have a lot of songs to sort through   it will get  stuck  rapidly going through the songs and wo nt stop until several seconds after you let your finger off of it ,negative,wheel,wheel[-2],
it would have been much nicer if it had a window so you could see the screen  and if the button did nt cover up the ac jack ,negative,case,case[-1],
as it stands now  the case is pretty useless unless you re packing the player up for travel  or if you load up all your songs beforehand ,negative,case,case[-3],
overall  i feel that it s a decent buy  and am happy that i own it ,positive,player,player[+2],[p]
i am willing to overlook it s problems to get superior sound quality and low price  although i feel the player has a lot of room for improvement ,positive,"sound, price, player","sound[+2], price[+2], player[-1]",
for the price and size and features  you can t beat the price ,positive,price,price[+2],
the buttons and interface are very easy to use ,positive,"button, interface","button[+3], interface[+3]",
simple click buttons  back buttons volume and display are very easy to read  access and use ,positive,"buttons, display","buttons[+3], display[+2]",
but the major problem i had was with the software ,negative,software,software[-2],
the instructions that come with it do nt explain how to make things simple ,negative,instruction,instruction[-2],
the quick sync is nt any good becuase it either needs to be configured properly or just is nt very useful ,negative,sync,sync[-2],
i tried to make sense of the file transfer program and just got more confused ,negative,transfer,transfer[-2],
with this mp3 player you get much more memory for much less than an ipod ,positive,player,player[+2],
i have found that the interface on the nomad is very easy to use if you have a basic knowledge of a computer ,positive,interface,interface[+3],
i have had no problem whatsoever with this product ,positive,product,product[+2],
the software installed flawlessly and without any problems on my windows 2k machine ,positive,software,software[+2],
the headphones are nt the best  but you can really expect much out of the small headphones you insert in the ear cavity ,negative,headphone,headphone[-1],
the battery life seems good  takes very lttle time to charge  it uploads mp3s quickly and there is no delay between songs ,positive,life,life[+2],
took me a few tries to get use to the navigation  but it s a very user friendly player imo ,positive,navigation,navigation[+2],
i have nt messed with the firmware at all  the player worked perfect for me right out of the box ,positive,player,player[+2],
allinall  this is another excellent creative product ,positive,product,product[+2],

i would recommend this product to anyone ,positive,product,product[+2],
before asking for the zen xtra specifically for christmas i researched many different mp3 players but finally decided on this one  and now that i have it i could nt be happier and i m convinced it s the best one out there ,positive,player,player[+3],
many people have written about the software being its one downfall  personally i have nt had a single problem with the software  i m running windows me ,positive,software,software[+2],
the cd ripping to mp3 is so easy  and you can even rip the cd directly to the mp3 player  so it wo nt take up space on your pc hard drive ,positive,rip,rip[+3],
the software runs smooth  it s nice to look at  it s very organized  easy to follow and makes things very simple ,positive,software,software[+2],
the controls on the player are very simple  no need for a manual ,positive,control,control[+2],
the player is fast and sounds great  it also has many options like slowing or speeding up the music  or making it sound like you re hearing the music in a huge auditorium ,positive,"player, sound","player[+2], sound[+3]",
the battery lasts very long when playing music  but writing files to the player drains the battery fast  so you need to have it plugged into an outlet when sending files ,positive,battery,battery[+2],
playlists can be made on the fly  without aid of a computer  and you can use play modes like shuffle and repeat for your  now playing  selections or playlists ,positive,playlist,playlist[+2],
the software could nt be better and the mp3 player works like a dream  i could nt give this anything but a 5  i wish there was a 6 ,positive,"software, player","software[+3], player[+3]",
it is an extremely cool gizmo ,positive,player,player[+3],[p]
the navigation is nice enough  but scrolling and searching through thousands of tracks  hundreds of albums or artists  or even dozens of genres is not conducive to save driving ,neutral,"navigation, scroll","navigation[+2], scroll[-2]",
creating playlists using the included software to minimize issue 3 was nt as easy as i would have liked ,negative,playlist,playlist[-2],
my only significant complaint is sound quality ,negative,quality,quality[-2],
the eax sound enhancement feature did nt do enough for me and the custom eq was a limited 5 band eq ,negative,eax,eax[-2],
i was unable achieve a sound quality on par with my simple portable cd player with  bass boost  ,negative,quality,quality[-2],
well i have to say that this product is very good i mean it might be a little big but it still fits in your pocket ,positive,product,product[+3],
well surely this is a product that i recommend someone in getting rather than any other mp3 player  at that size and the price  ,positive,product,product[+2],
well just one con  its not really plug and play at first i mean its very confusing to start the program but one you do it  it will be a breeze ,negative,program,program[-2],
not only is it more affordable  but its a better player for windows  which is what i have ,positive,"price, player","price[+2], player[+2]",[u]
it hasnt gone below the second notch  i charge mine whenever i m at home and not using it   so the battery life seems fine  so far ,positive,life,life[+2],
my only complaint would be that you need id3 tags  that takes a while to do if your mp3 files do nt have them ,negative,tag,tag[-2],
oh  and file transfers are fast  easy ,positive,transfer,transfer[+2],
a little weighty  9 ounces  no biggie   but otherwise fine ,negative,weight,weight[-1],

the big backlight makes things easy to see  and the writing is big enough for people to see ,positive,backlight,backlight[+2],
my favorite thing about the nomad is the eax feature ,positive,eax,eax[+2],
its really cool ,positive,eax,eax[+3],[p]
sound quality is amazing i was expecting worse  but its really good  especially if your files have good sound quality  ,positive,quality,quality[+3],
you can also slow a song down  speed it up  which is cool too ,positive,speed,speed[+3],
but the earbuds suck ,negative,earbud,earbud[-3],
i forgot  the case does nt fit ,negative,case,case[-2],
my case doesnt close  maybe mine was just faulty  but the case isnt that great ,negative,case,case[-2],
also  you can store data on it  which is a plus for all you people who want to buy an ipod just to say you have an ipod  do nt bother  this is a much better buy ,positive,storage,storage[+2],[u]
first i ll start off by saying that this players hardware is pretty good  ,positive,hardware,hardware[+2],
the sound is indeed excellent and the form factore is not bad  but still rather larger than i had expected   ,positive,"sound, size","sound[+3], size[-1]",[u]
what really made this a mediocre mp3 player for me was the software ,negative,software,software[-2],
bookmarks for example  are an excellent feature  but not on this player  ,negative,bookmark,bookmark[-2],
rather than creating a directory for bookmarks to be found in one area  the user must actually find the track where the bookmark was made  ,negative,bookmakr,bookmakr[-2],
this makes no sense and sort of defeats the purpose of audio bookmarks  ,negative,bookmark,bookmark[-2],
the dynamic playlists   now playing   i belive creative calls it  feels very awkward at times and some menus simply take to long to get to and operate  ,negative,playlist,playlist[-3],
while the ease of use was very impressive  i was put off by the price  about  130 more than what i paid amazon for this player ,positive,price,price[+2],[u]
i have had the nomad jukebox for about three weeks now  and i am very happy with it ,positive,nomad,nomad[+3],
it s only slightly heavier than the ipod  and has a longer battery life ,neutral,"weight, life","weight[-1], life[+1]",[u]
the storage capacity is great for me ,positive,capacity,capacity[+2],
the controls are somewhat harder to use than the ipod  but i have gotten use to them  and even at the beginning did not think would justify the huge difference in price ,negative,control,control[-1],
loading cds was somewhat timeconsuming  but i think it would have been with the ipod as well ,negative,load,load[-1],[u]
my only reservations about this product concern the tagging process and the way it interacts with the software ,negative,"tag, software","tag[-1], software[-1]",
other tagging problems result  i think  from the nomad s operating system ,negative,tag,tag[-2],
also  i can t understand why the software does not ignore  the  when it lists the cds in alphabetical order ,negative,software,software[-2],
finally  making playlists from the computer can be complicated because the tracks are listed individually  and are organized by cd  which are not listed but are organized in alphabetical order ,negative,playlist,playlist[-2],
the bottom line for me is that i am very happy with this product ,positive,product,product[+3],[p]
a lot of people complain about the creative software  but i actually find creative mediasource organizer to have some strengths over itunes ,positive,software,software[+2],
first  the zen lets you sync to more than one computer ,positive,sync,sync[+1],
the zen is an outstanding way to shuttle music between sources  you can t do this on the ipod  except for a cumbersome workaround using the ipod as a hard drive instead of a player  ,positive,shuttle,shuttle[+3],
second  the  automatic  sync on creative lets you review the songs before it begins its transfer ,positive,sync,sync[+1],
the zen serves as a backup device as well as a player ,positive,player,player[+2],
third  creative software allows you to keep two windows open to look at both the content on the player and the computer ,positive,software,software[+1],
only thing missing from creative is a cd burner ,negative,burner,burner[-2],
for those of us that like to tinker  i think creative offers some advantages ,positive,creative,creative[+2],
zen allows you to scroll up and down the song list selected on the player ,positive,scroll,scroll[+1],
it also lets you remove songs from the play order ,positive,remove,remove[+1],
if you bring up an album  but absolutely hate some of the tracks  the zen will allow you to delete that from the playing order ,positive,delete,delete[+1],
its ability to serve as a backup for my music collection is a huge plus,positive,zen,zen[+3],[p]
i got this thing for christmas and i have been very happy with it ever since ,positive,thing,thing[+3],[p]
the only thing i would complain about the zen xtra is that the controls are nt as easy as the ipod s  or as  sexy  looking ,negative,"control, look","control[-2], look[-2]",
the software is quick  easy to use  i found the entire process very easily mastered ,positive,software,software[+3],
as mentioned in other reviews the headphones are useless and need to be replaced right away ,negative,headphone,headphone[-3],
the unit works great with my cassette adapter for my car  is also easily worked without taking your eyes off the road ,positive,unit,unit[+2],
overall it is a great unit  hopefully creative labs or some other vendor will soon come out with some accessories for it ,positive,unit,unit[+2],
this did nt bother me too much because it s still a decent size ,positive,size,size[+1],
it comes with a good case that fits it snuggly ,positive,case,case[+2],
the front cover  which you remove to take out the battery  feels flimsy but when snapped on  the device still feels pretty solid ,negative,cover,cover[-1],
extremely convenient ,positive,software,software[+3],[u]
great price ,positive,price,price[+2],
i thought the software was decent enough  it was nt complicated to learn at all ,positive,software,software[+2],
the scroll button is sort of annoying to push  a nice button would be nicer but eh  not a big deal ,negative,scroll,scroll[-1],
it is slightly larger than an ipod  no doubt about it ,negative,size,size[-1],[u]
i m really happy with this purchase ,positive,player,player[+3],[p]
i would have liked to have given it 4 12 stars docking that 12 star only for the size ,negative,size,size[-1],
now heres the stuff you should know starting with the good things  the screen is really big and the blue light in the back is perfect  fast as hell in music transfer  controls are easy to use after mastering the scroll button  great sound and ive heard many mp3 players  a ton of different equilizer type deals on here ,positive,"screen, equilizer","screen[+3], equilizer[+2]",
there are a couple things i didnt like though but nothing serious  a little larger than other mp3s but still light  the software takes some time to get used to  maybe 1015 mins   and this thing would definitely be destroyed with one fall ,negative,"size, weight, software","size[-1], weight[+1], software[-1]",[u]
but it comes with a tank of a case and if you cut a piece out where the screen is you can always keep it in the case and still access everything ,positive,case,case[+1],

it also has unproven battery life ,negative,life,life[-2],
finally the software used to put all the songs into it is vastly inferior to itunes on two levels  first it is poorly integrated into the overall player and clunky to use especially with tagging and second the wma audio format sucks  flat out sucks in terms of sound quality compared with the vastly superior aac format the apple ipod uses and it sticks you with one of the sub par paid music services such as napster instead of allowing to use the itunes store  which  if you ever plan to pay for your music  is by far the best ,negative,software,software[-3],

however  i do nt like to carry it on my belt because the clip is nt secure and the case can slip off ,negative,clip,clip[-1],
also  the carrying case that came with mine covers up the display  so even though the side controls are reachable  i have to open it up to see the display ,negative,case,case[-2],
this player is an overall disappointment with a couple of big flaws that potential buyers should be wary of  and all readers need to know about a third party software company that resolves virtually all of the creative mediasource file transfer issues ,negative,"player, software","player[-3], software[-2]",

m3u files are used by most mp3 players like musicmatch and winamp  but not creative  without notmad you need to manually recreate your playlists   it does nt care what software you use to rip or catalog your music  creative or any other company  all my 125 gb of music were transferred to the zen with correct tags  hooray ,positive,notmad,notmad[+2],

the creative software is awkward  difficult to use and just plain does nt load on some computers ,negative,software,software[-3],
enough people have reported that their headphone jack does nt work after a month of using the device to believe that creative has some inbuilt manufacturing or quality control problem ,negative,jack,jack[-2],

you need the software to actually transfer files,negative,transfer,transfer[-1],
the player has its minor glitches like for example when i turn it on  60 percent of the time  it sais  shutting down  which means i have to turn off  and turn it on again  which is not to my likings ,negative,player,player[-1],

accessing files by artist and album  i mostly look things up by artist  is easy and intuitive ,positive,file,file[+1],
possibly the biggest advantage this player has  if price was nt enough  is the fact that the user can replace the battery him  herself by opening the lid and popping in the new battery ,positive,battery,battery[+3],
since batteries do run out on everything  this will also be a big moneysaver since ipods  irivers  rca  dell  all have builtin batteries that need to be replaced by a technician  apple charges 100 bones for the battery replacement  ,positive,battery,battery[+3],
try before you buy if at all possible  although i am a mac addict now for over a decade and everyone i know has previously bought an ipod  the nomad zen xtra was a far better value and is just as easy to use with regards to both hardware and software interface ,positive,"value, use","value[+2], use[+2]",
